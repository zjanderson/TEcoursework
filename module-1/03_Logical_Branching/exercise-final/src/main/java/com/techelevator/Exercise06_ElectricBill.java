    Customers with renewable energy can put electricity back into the grid. Each customer's net usage (units used - units returned)
    is calculated so that Tech Electric can determine what discounts to apply and whether the customer should receive money back.

    - The first 100 units are $0.20 per unit.
    - Anything more than 100 units is calculated at a cost of $0.25 per unit.
    - Any customer who puts electricity back into the grid receives a 5% discount.
    - If a customer returns more energy than they've used, they receive a credit of $0.20 per unit for each returned unit.
      Their credit does not include the 5% discount.

    calculateElectricBill(50, 0) ➔ 10.0
    calculateElectricBill(50, 4) ➔ 8.74
